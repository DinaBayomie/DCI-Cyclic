<h1>Correlating Unlabeled Events from Cyclic Process Execution
<h5>By: Dina Bayomie, Ahmed Hany

To run our code first: 
- run Behavioral profile 
  - Get jbpt library from "https://code.google.com/p/jbpt"
  - See "https://code.google.com/p/jbpt/source/browse/trunk/jbpt-test/src/test/java/org/jbpt/test/tree/BCTreeTest.java" to add a process model.
  - Add process model in "main" of Relationship matrix project
- run _int.main in DCI using python 2.7 , with arguments
  - Unlabeled event log in (.txt or .csv) formats
  - Heuristic data in (.csv) format
  - Ranking score threshold

The output exists in 4 folders:
- labeledEventLog_txt
- labeledEventLog_csv
- labeledEventLog_xes
- otherEventLog_all [which will contain Noisy event logs and also event logs below thershold ]
